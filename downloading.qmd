### Published data repositories

Published sequencing data is deposited online in

-   SRA (Sequence Read Archive)

    -   The SRA is a repository for raw sequencing data

        -   Long and short reads from any platform (Illumina, PacBio..)

    -   Organised with unique identifiers

        -   SRP = Project/Study (1 or more samples )

        -   SRS = Sample (1 or more experiments)

        -   SRX = Experiment (1 or more runs i.e technical replicates)

        -   SRR = Run (results for 1 sequencing run)

    -   Runs stored in *sra* format

        -   Reads saved in *spots*

    -   Smaller datasets and metadata can be downloaded via links in each run

    -   Other download options

        -   <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sradownload/>

        -   SRA Toolkit (see below)

        -   Cloud access

-   GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus)

    -   Genomics data repository for high throughput experiments

        -   Experimental metadata

        -   Processed data e.g bigWig read profiles, ChIP-seq peak files, RNA-seq read count tables

        -   Links to raw data (SRA)

        -   Links to publication

    -   Data organised into

        -   Series and super series (GSE)

        -   Samples (GSM)

    -   Most publications will contain a GEO series ID.

    -   Download links are available at the bottom of each GEO submission.

        -   To download to the server

            -   Right click to "Copy link as"

            -   Use `wget` or `curl` on the command line to download using the URL

-   ENA (European Nucleotide Archive)

    -   ENA is repository for sequencing data hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute.

    -   To download raw sequencing files from a project:

        -   Select the fastq files you require.

        -   Hit the "Get Download Script" button.

        -   Run the script on the terminal command line on your computer or on the server.

        -   e.g. `sh ena-file-download-read-run-PRJNA112117-fastq_ftp-20240623-919.sh`
